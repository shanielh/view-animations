# What is this?

Helps to create animations that starts when element becomes visible to the view 
of the browser. [Like here](http://css-tricks.com/slide-in-as-you-scroll-down-boxes/)

## How to use it?

Two ways :

1. Declerative : add `data-on-visible-class` to the wanted element (See example in docs/index.html)
2. Imperative : Use the script, It's pretty straightforward
